# HTML Practice

https://cbarber1984.github.io/simple_page/

After spending several weeks working through the freeCodeCamp modules for algorithmic scripting, object oriented programming, and functional programming, I decided to build a simple HTML site with some JavaScript functions to reveal and hide the navigation panel on the left hand side of the page.

##To-Do List:
• Use CSS to style elements
• Practice integrating Visual Studio Code and GitHub to manage local changes to the code and the repo here.
